## Regression model
Consider the data from the file weight-height.csv.

1) Inspect the dependence between height and weight using a scatter plot. You may use either of the variables as independent variable.

2) Choose appropriate model for the dependence

3) Convert lengths from inches to centimeters and weights from pounds to kilograms.

4) calculate the means, medians, standard deviations, and variances of the lengths and weights.

5) Compute RMSE and R2 value

7) Assess the quality of the regression (visually and using numbers).
